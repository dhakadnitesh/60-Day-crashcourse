          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Grains are small, hard seeds from plants like wheat, rice, and corn.
            They are a main food source worldwide and give us energy, fiber, and
            important nutrients. Whole grains have all parts of the seed, while
            refined grains have some parts removed, losing some nutrients. Whole
            grains are healthier because they have more fiber and nutrients. We
            use grains in many foods like bread, pasta, and cereals.

          <h3>Benefits</h3>
          <p>
            Grains are great because they give us lots of energy and important
            nutrients. They help keep our digestion healthy and can make us feel
            full, which helps control weight. Eating whole grains is good for
            our heart and helps keep blood sugar levels steady. The fiber in
            grains prevents constipation and lowers the risk of some diseases.
            Grains are also versatile and can be used in many recipes, plus they
            are affordable and easy to find.
